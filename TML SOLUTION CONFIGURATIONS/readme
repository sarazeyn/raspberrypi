Common TML Solution Configurations / Suggestions:
1. The MAIN TML solution container is in Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/maadsdocker/seneca-iot-tml-kafka-amd64
2. This container is about 5.6GB
3. When running the container - the TML Dashboard will take about ~1 minute to population
4. If it does not populate - press START or STOP STREAMING button a few times - it will eventually populate 
5. TML solution produces and processes lots of data - so make sure you VM disk is large enough - ~50GB or more
